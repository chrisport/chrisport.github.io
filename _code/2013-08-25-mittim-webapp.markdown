This was my bachelor thesis. The project consisted of a HTML/CSS/JS-WebApp using JQuery Mobile, linked to the native application Junaio (Metaio Gmbh).
In Junaio the drafts of the future buildings Mittim Effretikon can be viewed through the camera within the real environment in municipal Effretikon Switzerland.
